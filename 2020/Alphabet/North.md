Description:

North was a developer of smart glasses designed to provide information in front of the eyes instead of crouching over a smartphone. The company's eyewear gave heads-up access to digital life with custom-made glasses which gave discreet notifications that can be subtly managed with features like smart replies, emojis, snooze delays, and more, thereby enabling users to access the required information whenever needed.

Google bought the company in 2020. As part of the acquisition, the North' team joined the Google team based in Kitchener-Waterloo, Canada to help them build helpful devices and services.

Acquired on June 30, 2020
