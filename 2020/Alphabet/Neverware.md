Description:

Neverware was a New York City-based technology company. It is the developer of CloudReady, a distribution of Google's Chromium OS designed to be installed on existing computers (as opposed to Google's commercial version, Chrome OS, which is sold primarily as pre-loaded software on netbooks). 

Google bought the company in 2020. As part of the acquisition, Neverware's employees joined the main Chrome OS team and their technology was integrated into Google Cloud.

In February 2022, Google began to test a beta version of "Chrome OS Flex"-a distribution with a similar focus to CloudReady.

Acquired on December 11, 2020
