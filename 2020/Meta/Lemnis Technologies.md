Description:

Lemnis Techonologies was the developer of an AR-enabled computing platform intended to simplify the virtual simulation process. The company's platform was making VR/AR viable by providing natural visual cues in 3D displays by allowing control of focus dynamically in a head-mounted display eliminating eye strain and visual discomfort, thereby providing users with an immersive and comfortable VR experience.

Facebook bought the company in 2020. As part of the acquisition, Lemnis' team and technology were integrated into Facebook Reality Labs.

Acquired on September 18, 2020
