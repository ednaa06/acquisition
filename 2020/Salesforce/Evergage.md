Description:

Evergage was a cloud-based software that allows users to collect, analyze, and respond to user behavior on their websites and web applications in real-time. 

Salesforce acquired the company in 2020. As part of the acquisition, Evergage became part of Salesforce Marketing Cloud and was rebranded to Interaction Studio. 

Interaction Studio was renamed "Marketing Cloud Personalization" in April 2022.

Not only is Marketing Cloud Personalization a powerful promotional platform, the ability to harness data and use it to gain insights into your customer's behavior is incredibly valuable.
