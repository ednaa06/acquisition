Description:

Smash.gg (now start.gg) is the developer of an e-sports platform designed to facilitate e-sports markets from a bottom-up standpoint. 

The company's platform involves heavy real-time interaction between multiple parties in order to deliver real-time highly interactive tournaments and alert users of playable matches, enabling tournament organizers, content creators, and players to grow their tournaments, sales, and branding.

Microsoft acquired the company in 2020. With this acquisition, the Smash.gg community and tournament organizers would continue to benefit from the Smash' platform, while their team would benefit from additional resources and support as part of the Microsoft Content Services team.

Acquired on December 2, 2020
