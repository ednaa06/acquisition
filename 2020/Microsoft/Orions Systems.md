Description:

Orions Systems was the developer of an artificial intelligence-based video analysis platform designed to offer a better approach for handling unstructured data in machine learning systems than the typical taxonomy approach. The company's platform use design data based on semantics to generate ontological data, freeing the data from the limited structure and bounds of either being a simple string array or a rigid taxonomy, enabling clients to turn video fused with sensor data into business and operational intelligence in real-time.

Microsoft acquired the company in 2020. With this acquisition, Orions Systems would bring additional technologies that would allow solutions like Dynamics 365 Connected Store and the Microsoft Power Platform to offer a way to build and train their own AI models.

Acquired on July 7, 2020
