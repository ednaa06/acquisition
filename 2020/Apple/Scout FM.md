Description.

Scout FM was the provider of a podcast service intended to transform the way people discover and listen to audio content. The company's service combined the familiarity and ease of radio with the power of editorial curation and AI, enabling listeners to customize a station according to their individual tastes.

Apple bought the company in 2020. As part of the acquisition, the Scout App was removed from the store and their technology was integrated into Apple Podcasts to enhance its own podcast platform amid growing competition from Spotify.
