Mission:

Zoox was founded to make personal transportation safer, cleaner, and more enjoyableâ€”for everyone.

Amazon bought the company in 2020. As part of the acquisition, Zoox became an Amazon' subsidary and stayed as an independent entity to pursue its ambitious dream to develop a custom vehicle design suitable for a self-driving vehicle.
