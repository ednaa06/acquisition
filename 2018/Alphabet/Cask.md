Description:

Cask makes building and running big data solutions on-premises, in the cloud or in hybrid environments easy with Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP), the first unified integration platform for big data. CDAP reduces the time from prep to production for data lakes and data applications by 80%, empowering the business to make better decisions faster. CDAP is open source and accelerates time to value from Hadoop and Spark through standardized APIs, configurable templates and visual interfaces. 

Google acquired the company in 2018. As part of the acquisiton, Cask's platform CDAP continued open source and the team joined Google to help make developers more productive with their data processing services both in the cloud and on-premise.
