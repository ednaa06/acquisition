Description:

Semantic Machines is transforming assistive experiences by harnessing the full power of human language. Our approach to conversational AI orchestrates user input, conversational and on-screen context, and real-world APIs into a single machine-learned conversational system that is richly contextual and highly grounded. 

Combining the Semantic Machines technology with Microsoft's world-class products, the team aims to democratize access to technology by delivering a more productive and natural user experience that will take conversational computing to the next level.

Microsoft acquired the company in 2018. As part of the acquisition, the Semantic' team and their technology were incorporated into Microsoft. This acquisition was made to push forward the boundaries of what was possible in language interfaces.
