Description:

FSLogix was the developer of an app-provisioning platform designed to reduce the resources, time and labor required to support virtualization. The company's platform offered real-time access to enterprise applications, image reduction, license management, Office 365 container, profile container and demo videos.

Microsoft acquired the company in 2018. As part of the acquisition, the service was integrated to Microsoft Office 365 to help them extend their virtualization capabilities and provide an even richer experience.

Now as part of Office 365, FSLogix enhances and enables user profiles in Windows remote computing environments. FSLogix may also be used to create more portable computing sessions when using physical devices.
