Description:

Shazam is a mobile phone application that incorporates a service that allows the identification of music. The company is based in London and was founded in 1999 by Chris Barton , Philip Inghelbrecht, Dhiraj Mukherjee and Avery Wang. 

Shazam takes advantage of the built-in microphone in most mobile phones to be able to record a sample of music that is being played. An acoustic fingerprint is created from the sample and compared to a database for matches. Once the relationship is made, the user can receive information such as the title of the song, artist, album, links of interest to services such as iTunes, Youtube, Spotify or Groove Music, as well as other related song suggestions.

Mission:

"Our mission is to help people recognize and engage with the world around them"
