Description:

Tableau Software develops and sells software that enables customers to visualize and analyze data through a single, easy-to-use platform, primarily delivered as an on-premises solution. 

The company reports revenue in two business segments, with license contributing roughly half of total revenue while maintenance and services makes up the remaining half. The firm derives roughly 70% of its sales from the United States, with the remainder coming from international markets.

Mission:

Our mission today remains the same as when we first started: Help people see and understand data. It's never been more important. Together with Salesforce, we're delivering a successful data experience for everyone-from the workforce of today to the change-makers of tomorrow.

Salesforce acquired the company in 2019. As part of the acquisition, Tableau became a Salesforce' subsidary.
