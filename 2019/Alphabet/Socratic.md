Description:

Socratic is an education tech company that offers a mobile app for students. The app uses AI technology to help students with their homework by providing educational resources like videos, definitions, Q&A, links and more.

In August, 2019, Google acquired the company. The Founder and CTO (now engineering manager) Shreyans Bhansali announced that Socratic had joined Google later. The wake of news was accompanied by a redesigned iOS app.

After the acquisition, Socratic became no longer available for user contributions; past contributions were kept, but it was no longer possible to ask, answer, or edit questions. The app continued to work in the App Store.

Acquired on August, 2019
