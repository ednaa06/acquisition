Pull Panda was a privately held company that makes code review tools for developers using GitHub.

Microsoft bought the company in 2019. As part of the acquisition, Pull Panda's products - Pull Reminders; Pull Analytics; Pull Assigner - were available for free. Later their technology was integrated into GitHub features.

On April, 2022, GitHub announced that Pull Panda and Pull Analytics services were being shut down on June 21, 2022. The reason: there was a significant decrease in the usage of the remaining Pull Panda features.
