Description:

Spectral Edge was a developer of image processing and enhancement technologies designed to improve pictures and videos on mass-market devices. The company's technologies used machine learning to develop an image fusion technique which utilizes the full spectrum of colour to display multi-modal images without artefact, enabling consumer applications manufacturers to reveal more of the colour, detail and clarity on their devices.

Apple bought the company in 2019. As part of the acquisition, Spectral Edge was shut down and its technology was integrated to improve the camera quality of Apple's iPhone.

Acquired on December 12, 2019
