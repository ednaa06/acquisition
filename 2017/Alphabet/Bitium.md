Description:

Bitium was a developer of the cloud service Bitium, which provided single sign-on and identity management for software as a service (SaaS) cloud-based applications before its merger into Google Cloud. Bitium allows end users to access all of their cloud software accounts using a single set of login credentials. The product can integrate with cloud apps using SAML for enhanced security.

Google acquired the company in 2017. At the end of September 2018 Bitium announced that it would close down all accounts for customers outside the United States, Canada or Mexico at the end of 2018.

Bitium was fully merged with Google Cloud and ceased to exist in 2019. However some of its technology is still used by Google.
