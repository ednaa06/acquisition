Description:

Intentional Software was a software company that designed tools and platforms that followed the principles of intentional programming in which programmers focus on capturing the intent of users and designers, and spend as little time as possible interacting with machines and compilers. Its tools included language workbenches, tools that separated software function from implementation, and allowed 'language-focused' development. This allowed automatic rewriting of code as expert knowledge of implementation options changed. 

Microsoft bought the company in 2017. As part of the acquisiton, the Intentional Software' team joined Microsoft and their technology was integrated into their services.

Acquired on April 18, 2017
