Description:

Lattice was born out of the Stanford research project DeepDive, a framework for statistical inference. They were the researchers and creators behind DeepDive, and now they built on top of DeepDive to create products for industry and government. Their mission was to unlock the value in dark data for critical real-world problems.

Lattice Data was a company that applied an AI-enabled inference engine to take unstructured, "dark" data and turn it into structured (and more usable) information.

Apple bought the company in 2017. As part of the acquisition, about 20 engineers joined Apple' team and their technology was integrated into Apple's AI systems.

Acquired on May 13, 2017
