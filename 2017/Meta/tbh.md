Description:

tbh was an anonymous social media app available in the United States, designed for high school students. The app was launched by Nikita Bier, Erik Hazzard, Kyle Zaragoza, and Nicolas Ducdodon in September 2017.

In October 2017, tbh was ranked #1 in the U.S. App Store, and Facebook subsequently acquired the company for an estimated $100 million. tbh became one of the company's brands, alongside Facebook (app), WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and Oculus VR. However, on July 2, 2018, Facebook announced that tbh would be discontinued, due to low usage.

In August 2018, Buzzfeed News acquired a confidential memo in which the app's founders explained how they used Instagram to target teenagers at specific schools, playing to their curiosity and timing their messages to take advantage of the end of the school day.
