Description:

Scanline was founded in 1989 and is now led by Stephan Trojansky, a trailblazing VFX Supervisor whose proprietary fluid rendering system Flowline won an Academy Award for Technical Achievement in 2008.

Scanline is known for its complex, photorealistic effects and expertise in virtual production. It's also done an extraordinary job of supporting our creators on everything from the above-mentioned VFX achievements to those titles like Don't Look Up, The Gray Man, Slumberland, The Adam Project and Stranger Things 4. 

Netflix acquired the company in 2021. As part of the acquisition, Netflix invested in Scanline's pipeline, infrastructure and workforce and continue to support the pioneering work that Scanline's Eyeline Studios is doing in virtual production to push the boundaries of what is visibly possible.
