Description:

Playspace was a developer of a virtual meeting and collaboration platform intended to offer a dedicated, flexible space for meetings, brainstorms, team hangs, and everything in between. 

The platform's UI featured a navigation drawer that shows a list of meetings for the day, contacts with status indicators, a "Rooms" feature which offers built-in tools like a whiteboard, text scratchpad, and the ability for a group to listen to the same song, as well as, a "Magic Screenshare" tool that teleports everyone to a single desktop for centralized editing and annotation, enabling teams to work collaboratively on a single platform.

Google acquired the company in 2021. As part of the acquisition, Playspace's team and technology were integrated into Google Workspace.

Acquired on September 3, 2021
