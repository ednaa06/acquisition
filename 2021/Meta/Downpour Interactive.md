Description:

Downpour Interactive was founded with the goal of building an innovative first person shooter game for virtual reality platforms and the long term goal to build games that will make you think, feel, and learn new perspectives. 

Onward is Downpour Interactive's first game and is currently in active development and Early Access release. Onward has received critical acclaim for its immersion, combat mechanics, and realism.

Facebook acquired the company in 2021. As part of the acquistion, Downpour Interactive joined Oculus Vr. 

Becoming part of the Oculus Studios family would gave Downpour Interactive the opportunity to cultivate both the Onward community with the full support of Oculus Studios resources, and, in the future, pursue other projects.

Acquired on April 30, 2021
